                    Medellín’s past is filled with rich culture and significant transformations. Colombia’s second-biggest city is no stranger to turbulent times, however, Medellín’s ability to recover and progress is what gives it such an interesting story. While the City of Eternal Spring is now one of the coolest holiday destinations in the world, it’s taken many decades to arrive at this status.

From the vibrant Caribbean coast to the lush Andes, every region of Colombia brings its unique touch to this stunning mosaic.
